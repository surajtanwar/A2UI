# Agents (Server-Side)

Agents are server-side programs that generate A2UI messages in response to user requests.

The actual component rendering is done by the [renderer](renderers.md),
after messages are [transported](transports.md) to the client.
The agent is only responsible for generating the A2UI messages.

## How Agents Work

```
User Input → Agent Logic → LLM → A2UI JSON → Send to Client
```

1. **Receive** user message
2. **Process** with LLM (Gemini, GPT, Claude, etc.)
3. **Generate** A2UI JSON messages as structured output
4. **Send** to client via transport

User interactions from the client can be treated as new user input.

## Sample Agents

The A2UI repository includes sample agents you can learn from:

- [Restaurant Finder](https://github.com/google/A2UI/tree/main/samples/agent/adk/restaurant_finder) 
    - Table reservations with forms
    - Written with the ADK
- [Contact Lookup](https://github.com/google/A2UI/tree/main/samples/agent/adk/contact_lookup) 
    - Search with result lists
    - Written with the ADK
- [Rizzcharts](https://github.com/google/A2UI/tree/main/samples/agent/adk/rizzcharts) 
    - A2UI Custom components demo
    - Written with the ADK
- [Orchestrator](https://github.com/google/A2UI/tree/main/samples/agent/adk/orchestrator) 
    - Passes A2UI messages from remote subagents
    - Written with the ADK

## Different types of agents you will use A2A with

### 1. User Facing Agent (standalone)

A user facing agent is one that is directly interacted with by the user. 

### 2. User Facing Agent as a host for a Remote Agent

This is a pattern where the user facing agent is a host for one or more remote agents. The user facing agent will call the remote agent and the remote agent will generate the A2UI messages. This is a common pattern in [A2A](https://a2a-protocol.org) with the client agent calling the server agent.

- The user facing agent may "passthrough" the A2UI message without altering them
- The user facing agent may alter the A2UI message before sending it to the client

### 3. Remote Agent

A remote agent is not directly a part of the user facing UI. Instead it is registered in as a remote agent and can be called by the user facing agent. This is a common pattern in [A2A](https://a2a-protocol.org) with the client agent calling the server agent.
