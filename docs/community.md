# Community

Welcome to the A2UI community! We're building the future of agent-driven interfaces together.

## Get Involved

A2UI is an open-source project licensed under Apache 2.0. We welcome contributions from developers, researchers, and anyone interested in advancing agentic user interfaces.

## Community Showcase

!!! info "Coming soon..."
    We are considering how best to showcase community projects, examples, themes, renderers, custom components, and more.  A 4 minute (or less) demo video and code sample linked in Github discussions is a great way to show off your work.

## Project Partners

A2UI is developed in collaboration with several organizations:

### Google Opal

[Opal](http://opal.google) lets users build, edit, and share AI mini-apps using natural language. The Opal team has been a core contributor to A2UI's development.

### Flutter

The [GenUI SDK for Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/genui) uses A2UI as the UI declaration format for generating dynamic, personalized UIs in Flutter applications.

### Gemini Enterprise

A2UI is being integrated into [Gemini Enterprise](https://cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise?e=48754805) to enable custom agents to render rich, interactive UIs within enterprise applications.

### AG UI / CopilotKit

[AG UI](https://ag-ui.com/) and [CopilotKit](https://www.copilotkit.ai/) provide day-zero compatibility with A2UI, enabling developers to build rich, state-synced applications that render dynamic UIs from agents.

### A2A

Google's [A2A team](https://a2a-protocol.org/) have been core contributors to A2UI's development, with support from the A2A Technical Steering Committee (TSC).
